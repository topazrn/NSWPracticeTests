      "No, not at any time.",
      "Yes, but for no more than 30 minutes.",
      "Yes, in daylight hours."
    ],
    "explanation": "Parking on a median strip or traffic island is generally prohibited at all times, as these areas are designed to separate lanes of traffic and allow for safe movement of vehicles. Parking in these areas can obstruct traffic, create hazards, and is usually illegal. Always look for designated parking spaces or legal parking zones."

    "answers": [
      "Traffic is blocking the other side.",
      "A station is nearby.",
      "You are towing a caravan."
    ],
    "explanation": "You should not drive across a railway level crossing if traffic is blocking the other side, as this could result in your vehicle being stuck on the tracks, which is extremely dangerous. Always ensure that there is enough space to fully clear the crossing before you drive onto it. If traffic is backed up, wait until it clears before proceeding."

      "Have a large meal and a cup of coffee."
    ],
    "explanation": "Before driving a long distance, especially at high speeds or with a full car load, it is essential to check the tyre pressure. Properly inflated tyres ensure better fuel efficiency, safer handling, and reduce the risk of tyre blowouts. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended tyre pressure, which can typically be found in the vehicle's manual or on the inside of the driver's side door."

      "Hand your licence in at the nearest police station.",
      "Tell your doctor and let him or her notify Transport for NSW."
    ],
    "explanation": "If you become aware of a medical condition that may impair your ability to drive safely (such as a physical or mental condition that affects your driving skills), it is your responsibility to notify Transport for NSW. This helps ensure that your driving is safe for you and others on the road. Transport for NSW can provide guidance on how to proceed based on your medical condition. Handing your licence in at a police station or notifying a doctor is not the correct processâ€”directly contacting the relevant authorities ensures proper management of your driving eligibility."

    "explanation": "When approaching a bridge that is only wide enough for two vehicles, it is important to slow down and pay close attention to any oncoming traffic. Ensure there is enough space for both vehicles to pass safely. If necessary, be prepared to stop and give way to the other vehicle. Sounding your horn or maintaining speed could create unnecessary hazards in this situation, so caution is key."

      "Yes, but it is legal for a towbar or bicycle rack to cover the rear number plate.",
      "No, you are allowed to cover your number plates if you want to."
    ],
    "explanation": "It is an offence to obstruct the clear vision of your number plates at any time. Your number plates must be clearly visible and legible to allow law enforcement to easily identify your vehicle. While certain items, like a towbar or bicycle rack, may cover a portion of the rear number plate, the number plate itself must remain visible and unobstructed. Failing to ensure visibility can result in fines or penalties."

      "Move to the right and make way for the ambulance."
    ],
    "explanation": "In NSW, road rules require drivers to give way to emergency vehicles with flashing lights or sirens. The safest way to do this is to slow down, move to the left, and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. Turning into a driveway or moving to the right could create unnecessary risks or block the ambulance. Always prioritize the ambulance's safe and swift passage."

      "Check your seatbelt is back in place"
    ],
    "explanation": "Before exiting your vehicle, you must ensure it is safe to do so. Checking mirrors and blind spots helps avoid collisions with passing vehicles, cyclists, or pedestrians. While turning off headlights and ensuring the seatbelt is in place are good practices, safety comes first when exiting the vehicle."

      "Ask other occupants in the vehicle to watch out for possible dangers.",
      "Turn all your attention only to the road ahead."
    ],
    "explanation": "Safe driving requires situational awareness and constant scanning of your surroundings. This includes looking ahead for hazards, checking the sides for pedestrians or vehicles, and using your mirrors to monitor traffic behind you. Focusing only on the road ahead limits your awareness, and relying on passengers for spotting dangers is not a safe driving practice."

      "Keep driving because you have the green light.",
      "Pull over to the left before you reach the intersection."
    ],
    "explanation": "Emergency vehicles such as ambulances have priority over all other traffic, even if they are facing a red light. If an ambulance is approaching an intersection with sirens on, you must slow down and stop if needed to allow it to pass safely. Pulling over to the left is generally recommended on regular roads but might not always be safe or practical near an intersection. Prioritize yielding in a way that avoids obstructing the ambulance."

      "Yes, provided you have held a licence for two years."
    ],
    "explanation": "In NSW, it is illegal to tow more than one trailer with a car under any circumstances. The law permits towing only a single trailer, and any attempt to tow multiple trailers is prohibited for safety reasons. Always check the towing capacity and regulations for your specific vehicle."

      "Pull over to the left until the emergency vehicle passes.",
      "Immediately come to a stop.",
      "Let the emergency vehicle pass and follow it closely behind."
    ],
    "explanation": "When you hear the siren of an emergency vehicle, you must pull over to the left side of the road and stop (if itâ€™s safe to do so) to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. You should never follow the emergency vehicle too closely, as it can hinder their movement and be dangerous. Stopping or moving over gives them a clear path to get through traffic safely."

      "Looking in the rear and side mirrors continually when driving.",
      "Looking further ahead down the road when driving."
    ],
    "explanation": "Scanning while driving means staying aware of everything happening around you. This includes looking ahead to anticipate potential hazards, checking your side mirrors for vehicles or pedestrians, and using your rearview mirror to monitor traffic behind you. Constant scanning helps you stay alert and prepared to react to changes in traffic or road conditions."

      "Stop at a shop and get a drink that contains caffeine to help keep you awake.",
      "Make sure you get plenty of fresh air circulating inside the car by winding down your window."
    ],
    "explanation": "Fatigue is a serious hazard when driving, and the best way to handle tiredness is to stop safely and rest. Caffeine or fresh air might provide temporary relief, but they are not substitutes for proper rest. If you feel tired, itâ€™s essential to take a break, even if it means delaying your journey. Your safety and the safety of others on the road depend on it."

      "Slow down and only give way to traffic on your right.",
      "Stop completely at all times and have no right of way."
    ],
    "explanation": "A GIVE WAY sign indicates that you must yield to any traffic that may pose a danger of collision. This means you should slow down, be prepared to stop, and allow other vehicles or pedestrians to pass if necessary. You do not have to stop completely unless there is a risk of a collision, but you must be ready to give way."

      "Increase your speed to avoid any approaching trains.",
      "Continue across at normal speed, do not slow down."
    ],
    "explanation": "When approaching a railway level crossing, itâ€™s essential to slow down and look both ways to check for any oncoming trains. Even if the crossing does not have flashing lights or barriers, you must always be ready to stop if necessary. This ensures that you can react to any situation safely and avoid crossing when a train is approaching."

    ],
    "explanation": "Seat belts and child restraints are required for all passengers in a vehicle, regardless of the length of the trip. This is a legal requirement to ensure the safety of everyone in the car.
